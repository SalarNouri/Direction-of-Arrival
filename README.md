# Direction of Arrival Estimation

Direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation involves determining the direction of arrival of electromagnetic waves or sources using the outputs of multiple receiving antennas, which together form a sensor array. DOA estimation is a critical problem in array signal processing and finds extensive applications in fields such as radar, sonar, and wireless communications. Over the past decade, significant advancements in this research area have been driven by developments in sparse representation and compressed sensing techniques.

## Overview

In signal processing, DOA denotes the direction from which a propagating wave typically arrives at a specific point, where a set of sensors is usually located.

Antenna arrays are commonly employed in various digital signal processing applications due to their capability to locate signal sources accurately. DOA estimation represents a fundamental task in array signal processing.
