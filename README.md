# Direction of Arrival

Direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation refers to the process of retrieving the direction information of several electromagnetic waves/sources from the outputs of a number of receiving antennas that form a sensor array. DOA estimation is a major problem in array signal processing and has wide applications in radar, sonar, wireless communications, etc. With the development of sparse representation and compressed sensing, the last decade has witnessed a tremendous advance in this research topic.

- In signal processing, DOA denotes the direction from which usually a propagating wave arrives at a point, where usually a set of sensors are located.

- Antenna arrays are used in many digital signal processing applications due to their ability to locate signal sources. DOA estimation is a key task of array signal processing.
